This policy allows Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) Conversion Servers, which are EC2 instances launched by Elastic Disaster Recovery, to communicate with the DRS service. An IAM role with this policy is attached (as an EC2 Instance Profile) by DRS to the DRS Conversion Servers, which are automatically launched and terminated by DRS, when needed. We do not recommend that you attach this policy to your IAM users or roles. DRS Conversion Servers are used by Elastic Disaster Recovery when users choose to recover source servers using the DRS console, CLI, or API.","CreateDate":"2021-11-17T13:42:23.000Z","UpdateDate":"2023-11-27T13:13:38.000Z"},"document":[{"Effect":"Allow","Action":["drs:SendClientMetricsForDrs","drs:SendClientLogsForDrs"],"Resource":["*"]},{"Effect":"Allow","Action":["drs:GetChannelCommandsForDrs","drs:SendChannelCommandResultForDrs"],"Resource":["*"]}]}]}},"pageContext":{"PolicyName":"AWSElasticDisasterRecoveryConversionServerPolicy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["256249292"],"slicesMap":{}}
